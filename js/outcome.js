/* ============================================================
   ONE SESSION-OUTCOME AUTHORITY

   "Did she train, how much, and does it pay?" used to be answered
   independently in the engine, the store, four view-models and the effort
   score — and they disagreed. The engine's `completedFully` meant only "the
   loop reached the end", so skipping every move still read as a finished
   session; meanwhile a session of 7-of-8 reps on every move read as NOTHING,
   because only a `done` ledger row counted as work.

   This module is the single answer. It is pure and dependency-free so the
   store, the view-models and the tests can all import it without a cycle.
   Nothing else may re-derive completion.
